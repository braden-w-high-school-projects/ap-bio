            <p class="lead">There was definitely reason to be worried. Our first test was utter devastation; shock and awe as the numbers made surreal an outcome nobody was really ready to accept. So too was the summer lab grades, and everything else initially.</p>
            <p class="lead">But there was no reason to be scared. Adaptations formed quickly, and teamwork and good study habits drove home a path that is easy with the right work ethic and guidance.</p>
            <p class="lead">This is what this guide is for: guidance. You will adapt to AP Biology one way or another; the only question is how fast. This guide hopefully is the catalyst you need. Take note of all the materials and tips, and keep them forever close to heart. Good luck!</p>

            <h4> There should be a fine distinction between study for the actual AP tests and the course tests. The course tests are far more rigorous and detailed, while the AP Bio review will take place after all of the tests are complete, and so those textbooks are designed for review over learning.</h4>
              <ul>
              <li>Test Study - Do not discount the importance of what you are given</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Textbook (Campbell) - The ultimate resource for consulting all tests and learning. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this, but it is incredibly dense.</li>
              <li>Prep book (School provided) - One of the best assets to summarizing Campbell <em>but is not a substitute.</em></li>
              <li>Any AP Prep Book - These can cover a lot of similar ground and so are not a bad choice if you are in a crunch.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>AP Bio Prep Book -</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Pearson&rsquo;s - I&rsquo;ve never used it, but it has been universally acclaimed to be one of the best by all of my friends and online reviewers. You should pick one up as it seems pretty good. :)</li>
              <li>CliffsNotes - Very reputable, good educational content. However, they have a reputation to be a little dense so watch out.</li>
              <li>Barron&rsquo;s - Incredibly helpful review questions, and many of them as well. In my experience, one of the least educational and fun review content so use another prep book for actual review while using this for questions.</li>

            <li><strong>Loafing</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Do NOT Procrastinate</strong>. This is usually not a problem for individuals but <strong><em>plagues every single lab group</em></strong>. Start early, end early.</li>
            <li>Watch out for diffusion of responsibility. In groups, people are more prone to expecting others to initiate action, <strong>until nobody actually initiates.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Be proactive</strong> to prevent loafing.</li>
            <li><strong>Do NOT</strong> always think you will get to do team efforts in everything. That is far from the case in many cases, and you should be ready to take control yourself sometimes (though favor teamwork as it makes things easier).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Performance</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Have a strong internal locus of control.</strong> You can fix anything with good study and work, so remember that things are ultimately in your control over anyone else&rsquo;s.</li>
            <li>Get enough <strong><em>sleep</em>. </strong>Too little and you will be locked in the vicious cycle of exhaustion, leading to more extra work, leading to more exhaustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat well</strong> to feel energized and motivated. No caffeine required.</li>
            <li>When all else fails, don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself. A lot of things can change very quickly and <strong>only be upset if you feel you didn&rsquo;t try your hardest, not that the course was too hard.</strong></li>

The key is in breaking down the tasks as far as possible, and then planning accordingly. This investment is CRUCIAL to having a good time. It took much more time than expected, but that should almost be expected as you will learn not to think you can do things so fast.</span></p>
